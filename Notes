Sometimes a type cannot be constructor-injected. This can
happen for multiple reasons. For example, you cannot
constructor-inject an interface. You also cannot constructor-inject
a type that you do not own, such as a class from an external library.
In these cases, you can provide Hilt with binding information by
using Hilt modules.

A Hilt module is a class that is annotated with @Module.
Like a Dagger module, it informs Hilt how to provide instances
of certain types. Unlike Dagger modules, you must annotate Hilt
modules with @InstallIn to tell Hilt which Android class each
module will be used or installed in.
